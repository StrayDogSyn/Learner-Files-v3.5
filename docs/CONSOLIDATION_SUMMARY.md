# Marvel Quiz Featured Project - Consolidation Summary

## Overview

Successfully consolidated the Marvel Quiz featured project demonstration into the main portfolio (`index.html`), removing redundant standalone files for improved codebase clarity and professionalism.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed CSS Syntax Errors in `index.html`

**Location:** Lines 798-800

**Issue:** Orphaned CSS properties without a selector causing syntax errors

```css
/* BEFORE - Syntax Error */
.btn-primary:hover::before, .btn-secondary:hover::before {
    left: 100%;
}
    justify-content: center;  /* ❌ No selector */
    min-width: 120px;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

```css
/* AFTER - Fixed */
.btn-primary:hover::before, .btn-secondary:hover::before {
    left: 100%;
}

.btn-primary, .btn-secondary {
    justify-content: center;  /* ✅ Proper selector */
    min-width: 120px;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

**Result:** All CSS syntax errors in `index.html` resolved ✅

### 2. Removed Redundant Standalone File

**Deleted:** `marvel-quiz-featured-enhanced.html`
