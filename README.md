## üí° About Me

With over three years transitioning from the fast-paced world of fine dining to building intelligent software solutions, I've brought the discipline, creativity, and precision of a chef into my coding journey. Now studying Computer & Networking Technology at CCRI, I focus on applying real-world experience to develop impactful applications.

I believe in shipping working code over perfect code, and in learning by doing. My approach pairs hands-on problem-solving with a commitment to continuous growth‚Äîdelivering practical solutions while learning new technologies and techniques.

From crafting culinary experiences to designing software and integrating AI, I blend technical expertise with a human-centered mindset. Every project is a new opportunity to learn, adapt, and create something truly meaningful, drawing on the lessons learned in both the kitchen and the tech lab.
