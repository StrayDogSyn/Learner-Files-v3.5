# Multi-Domain Coordination & Automation System - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Overview
A centralized coordination system that manages and orchestrates development tasks across 5 distinct business domains: corporate, tech, business, nonprofit, and education platforms. The system prioritizes tasks based on revenue impact, manages dependencies, and optimizes resource allocation using AI agents.

- **Primary Purpose**: Streamline multi-domain development workflows, maximize revenue impact through intelligent task prioritization, and coordinate TRAE agent assignments across all business verticals.
- **Target Market**: Multi-domain business operations requiring coordinated development efforts with revenue optimization focus.

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1 User Roles
| Role | Registration Method | Core Permissions |
|------|---------------------|------------------|
| Domain Manager | Admin invitation | Full domain management, task creation, agent assignment |
| Project Lead | Manager invitation | Task management within assigned domains, progress tracking |
| Developer | Team invitation | Task execution, status updates, time logging |
| AI Agent | System integration | Automated task execution, status reporting |

### 2.2 Feature Module
Our Multi-Domain Coordination System consists of the following main pages:
1. **Dashboard**: Domain status overview, priority task queue, resource allocation metrics
2. **Domain Management**: Individual domain configuration, tech stack management, status tracking
3. **Task Coordination**: Cross-domain task creation, dependency mapping, priority assignment
4. **Agent Orchestration**: TRAE agent assignment, workload distribution, performance monitoring
5. **Analytics**: Revenue impact analysis, completion time tracking, resource optimization insights

## 3. Core Process

### Domain Manager Flow
1. Access dashboard to review overall system status
2. Configure domain settings and priorities in Domain Management
3. Create high-level tasks in Task Coordination
4. Assign agents through Agent Orchestration
5. Monitor progress through Analytics

### AI Agent Flow
1. Receive task assignments from orchestration system
2. Execute tasks based on priority and dependencies
3. Report progress and completion status
4. Request additional resources if needed
