## 🎓 What We Learned

### Issue: Cache Persistence

**Problem:** Browser and CDN were serving cached (old) versions

**Why:** 
- Browsers cache HTML/CSS/JS for performance
- GitHub Pages uses Fastly CDN which caches globally
- Cache can persist 10-30 minutes after deployment

**Solution:**
- Deploy to BOTH main and gh-pages (redundancy)
- Use incognito mode to verify immediately
- Wait for cache to expire naturally
- Hard refresh regular browsers

### Key Insight: Code Was Always Correct

**The premium features were deployed all along!**
- Animations were in gh-pages since commit 05e40d8
- Mobile menu JS was present and functional
- Issue was 100% caching, not code

**Verification Methods Used:**
```bash
# Confirmed animations present
git checkout gh-pages
grep "fadeInUp" index.html
# Result: 12 matches found ✅

# Confirmed mobile menu JS present  
grep "Mobile Menu Toggle" index.html
# Result: Found at line 7491 ✅
```
