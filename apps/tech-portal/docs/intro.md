  const handleAnalysis = async (document: string) => {
    const result = await analyzeDocument({
      content: document,
      context: 'criminal-justice-reform',
      analysisType: 'bias-detection'
    });
    
    console.log('AI Analysis:', result);
  };
  
  return (
    <div className="glass-card p-6">
      <h3 className="gradient-text">Legal Document Analysis</h3>
      {/* Your UI here */}
    </div>
  );
}
```
