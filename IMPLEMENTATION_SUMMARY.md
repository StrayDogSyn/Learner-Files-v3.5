Text Primary:    #f1f5f9  /* Headings */
Text Secondary:  #94a3b8  /* Body text */
Accent Blue:     #3b82f6  /* Interactive */

## 🔄 Comparison: Before vs After

### Before (Issues)
- ❌ Duplicate HTML causing layout breaks

## 💡 Key Decisions Made

### 1. Standalone File Approach
**Why:** Your existing index.html is 7,483 lines with complex inline styles. Creating a clean standalone version:
- ✅ Avoids conflicts with existing code
- ✅ Provides a working reference
- ✅ Easy to test independently
- ✅ Can be merged later if desired

### 2. Inline JavaScript
**Why:** For a single-page application with one interactive component:
- ✅ Simpler to understand and modify
- ✅ No additional HTTP requests
- ✅ Easier debugging
- ✅ Self-contained solution

### 3. Glassmorphic Design
**Why:** Modern, professional aesthetic that:
- ✅ Matches tech industry standards
- ✅ Provides visual hierarchy
- ✅ Works well with dark backgrounds
- ✅ Enhances readability

---

## 📊 Code Quality

### HTML
- Semantic elements (`<section>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`)
- Proper meta tags for SEO
- Accessible button labels
- Clean, indented structure

### CSS
- CSS custom properties (variables)
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Consistent naming conventions
- Optimized for performance

### JavaScript
- ES6+ modern syntax
- Clear variable naming
- Commented code sections
- Efficient DOM manipulation
- Error handling
